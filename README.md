😃😃Hi, I’m @Kikindi! I’m passionate about programming and the world that relies on it. Currently, I’m diving into web design and sharpening my skills in UI/UX. I’m always excited to collaborate on projects related to web development and interface design. In my free time, I enjoy joining tech and software seminars on Zoom to keep learning and growing. Let’s connect and create something amazing together! 🚀🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️
